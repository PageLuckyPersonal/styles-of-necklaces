    <p>This custom necklace name design lets you show off your first, last, or nickname in a beautiful way. You may pick between a necklace with names representing the whole family, or a single style with just a single person's name. Sometimes called named
      necklaces, this style is designed for everyday wear, and not so much dress occasions. They look good with every neck shape and width, and can easily be stacked for layered looks.

    <p>A beautiful pearl necklace is an excellent choice for any special occasion. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder(and greatly up to personal preference), but you may find that different colors of pearls suit different skin types. A medium to slender
      neck looks beautiful with a fitted pearl choker or single pearl necklace style. You can wear it for date night or to a cocktail party with an evening dress. Shorter or wider neck sizes should avoid overly fitted styles that can make your neck area
      look heavier and more bulky. You can purchase a necklace with pearls in many different colors. Paler colors like white, cream, and pink look best on light skin tones. Medium skin tones pair beautifully with gold, light cream, and black pearls. Darker
      skin tones can wear black pearls for a barely there affect, gold for a warm natural look, or white pearls for a drastic pop of color. There are no rules, so try different hues until you find your best pearls necklace.

    <p>With a custom initials necklace you can proudly wear your first, last, or middle initial around your neck. A necklace with initials could come in a fitted choker style, loose fit, or on a low hanging pendant. The best way to choose your initial necklace
      is by the length and shape you design. You don't need to focus as much with this style on the neck width or shape. Instead decide the initials size and length of chain you want. In general the closer to your face, the more petite you want the initials.
      The further away the initials the larger they can be. Monogram initials hanging on a long initial pendant necklace are great for every body type.

    <p>A locket necklace is perfect for birthstones, cubic zirconias, and other charms. It's such a popular style, you can easily customize a set to go with it. Add a locket bracelet or ring to go with the necklace and you'll have a personalized look from
      head to toe. Necklaces with lockets usually holds smaller objects inside, and some of them include engraved plates. Since this adds slightly more weight and bulk to the finished design, it's best to choose bust level or longer styles. You want the
      weight of the family tree, heart shape, or other locket style to fit between the chest or below so that it hangs freely. If you choose a heart locket necklace that sits above the bust area, it may look bulky or not lay nicely against the skin.

    <p>Nameplates necklace styles show off your full first, last or middle name, usually on a bar. Nameplates necklaces are considered a more youthful design, but anyone can wear them really. Though the idea behind the design is to add your name, you can
      also have unique text engraved on a name plate necklace too. This kind of necklace is best in choker or slightly loose chain lengths. You want to avoid low hanging necklace nameplate styles because the skin is needed to keep the plate from turning.
      The bar should rest delicately on the skin somewhere around the collar bone or just slightly lower. Once it's placed overly the skin, it should turn less. Another low hassle option that's very beautiful are choker styles that won't turn at all if
      properly fitted. Short or wide necks should look for slightly loose styles. Long or very slender necks will look great in a choker.

    <p>Custom birthstone necklaces are typically given as gifts and are most purchased for a mother or grandmother. Custom birthstone necklace styles are unlimited. There isn't really a neck shape that can't wear a birthstone necklace, and there are simply
      to many to cover. When it comes to this style of necklace, it's more important to consider the person you're giving it to. Since customized birthstone necklaces are rarely purchased by the person who will be wearing them, try to consider the recipient's
      jewelry style. For example if you're making one for grandma and she only wears pendants, then that's the style you should look for. If mom mostly wears lightly fitted delicate necklaces, then consider a lightweight birthstone bar or bezel set cubic
      zirconia necklace.

    <p>You can choose a sterling silver heart necklace and have it engraved, or create your own custom heart necklace. Customizable heart necklaces are typically better in slgihtly loose or hanging pendant styles. We've already mentioned the importance of
      distance from the face with builkier chamr styles and pendants. This is another kind of necklace where the style and length should be considered. Choose your heart charm necklace in relation to your neck shape and the size of the heart charm. Slim,
      long neck con generally wear this style in any length. Keep in mind though, that slim necks look weighted down by a large heart. Stick to petite heart styles. Wider or short necks should avoid chokers and look for longer chain lengths. However they
      can also wear large statement pieces and oversized heart shapes beautifully.
